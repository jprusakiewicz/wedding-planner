The file `/wedding-planner/public/favicon.ico` should contain the favicon for the web app. Since the favicon is a binary file, I cannot generate its contents. However, you can use any favicon generator tool or find a suitable favicon image online and save it as `favicon.ico` in the `public` directory of your project.
